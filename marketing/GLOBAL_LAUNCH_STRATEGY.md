# Global Launch Strategy: Excel Cleaner/Merger
**Target Audience**: Data Analysts, Accountants, Admin Assistants, Small Business Owners.
**Core Value Prop**: "Merge messy Excel files without VBA/Python knowledge. Data stays local."

## Phase 1: Validation & Initial Users (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Get 100 active users and 5 detailed feedback items.

### 1. Reddit (The Primary Battlefield)
Reddit is the best place for this tool because users are actively asking for help with this *exact* problem.

*   **Subreddits**:
    *   `r/excel` (700k+ members): The most critical community. Strict rules against self-promotion, so you must provide *value* first.
    *   `r/dataanalysis` (100k+): Focus on "cleaning messy data".
    *   `r/SaaS` / `r/IndieHackers`: For "Building in Public" feedback.
    *   `r/Accounting`: Accountants deal with messy CSV exports daily.

*   **Strategy**: "The Solver" Approach.
    *   **Don't** just post "Check out my tool".
    *   **Do** find recent posts asking "How to merge CSVs?" and reply: "I had this exact problem, so I built a free tool to do it locally. It handles different headers automatically. Try it here: [Link]."
    *   **Do** create a standalone post: "I built a tool to merge 500+ Excel files because Power Query was too slow. It's free and local. Roast it."

### 2. Twitter / X (#BuildInPublic)
*   **Goal**: Build credibility and connect with other founders.
*   **Tags**: `#Excel`, `#DataScience`, `#IndieHacker`, `#BuildInPublic`.
*   **Content**:
    *   Show a 10-second video of merging 10 files.
    *   "Before vs After" screenshots of messy data.

### 3. Indie Hackers / Hacker News
*   **Hacker News (Show HN)**: "Show HN: Local-first Excel merger with AI schema mapping".
    *   *Warning*: They are very technical. Expect questions about "Why not just use Pandas?" Answer: "For non-coders."

## Phase 2: The "Launch" (Week 3)
**Goal**: Spike in traffic (500+ visitors).

### Product Hunt Launch
*   **Timing**: Tuesday or Wednesday at 12:01 AM PST.
*   **Assets Needed**:
    *   Video demo (30-60s).
    *   High-quality screenshots (English UI).
    *   First comment explaining *why* you built it.

---

## Phase 3: Content Marketing (Long Term)
*   **SEO**: "Merge Excel files online free", "Combine CSVs different headers".
*   **Tools**: Submit to AI directories (There's An AI For That, etc.).

## Key Differentiation (vs Competitors)
1.  **"Data Stays Local"**: Privacy is huge for financial data.
2.  **"Messy Headers"**: Most tools fail if column A is "Email" in file 1 and "E-mail" in file 2. Your AI mapping is the killer feature.
3.  **"No Login Required"** (Initially): Low friction.
